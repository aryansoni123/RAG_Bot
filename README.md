# 🤖 Talos - Multimodal AI Assistant

Talos is a powerful multimodal AI assistant capable of processing and understanding PDF documents, CSV data, and audio files (WAV/MP3). It monitors changes in the data directory in real-time and updates embeddings using FAISS for efficient semantic search. It also utilizes reranking via a cross-encoder model for enhanced retrieval quality and answers queries using Google's Gemini LLM.
